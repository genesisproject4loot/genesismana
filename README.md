## Chapter 1: Genesis Mana
For Loot Bag holders, distill Genesis Mana (mint an ERC721 NFT) from any item in your bag that has an Order (item with suffix &ldquo;of ____&rdquo;).

Genesis Mana is essentially a Mint Pass for a Genesis Adventurer.
Upon collecting 8 Genesis Mana from a single Order, corresponding to all 8 item types (i.e. weapon, head armor, chest armor, etc), a Genesis Adventurer can be resurrected.
